Check-In 5 - Multiple Regression and MemoMultiple regression lets you examine whether two more or more   explanatory   variables   explain   the variable you are interested in, simultaneously. Or   an   equivalent way   of   thinking   about   this,   that has a different intuition, is   that it allows us to examine whether an explanatory variable we   are   interested   in   explains   the   variable   of   interest   after   controlling   for   (or   holding   constant)   variation   in   other   variables.   Using   the   simple   regressions   you   ran   in   Check-In-4   as   a   starting   point,   run   a   multiple   regression   with   two   or   more   variables   on   the   right-hand   side.   In   this   regression,   you are   trying to get   to the heart of   the questions listed in Section 1.   Run and tabulate   this   regression.   You   have   to   decide   what   tells   the   story   in   the   clearest   and   most   compelling   manner.
Now take a step back and write a paragraph explaining your results
Finally, pull your results together in a memo (see next section for   further   details).
Deliverables
The final memo should be one to two pages (including your table, and a figure if   you choose   to   include one). Adhere strictly to the page limit --- your audience needs   to   be briefed briefly!
This   should   be   a   doc   file   or   PDF.   Also   attach   your   Stata   do   file   (clearly   annotated)   to   the   assignment submission, as a   separate   file.
Use a   12-point font and a maximum of   double   spacing.         Check-in 5 is due no   later than   6:00pm on   December   17.
Points to Consider in Writing the Memo
Your audienceWrite   at   a   level that this   audience   can   appreciate. You   are   addressing people who   are   familiar   with   basic   numerical   concepts   (averages, percents). However, most   are   probably   not   aware   of concepts like hypothesis testing, regression coefficients, and so on   –   after   all, you   didn’t know   about these until you took Stat   1. Such technical terms do not belong in your memo,   unless you   also   explain them   in plain   English.代 写Check-In 5 - Multiple Regression and MemoR

Tips on organizing and writing a memo
Typically, memos of   this sort are organized   as   follows:
1.       Introduction. What are you going to talk   about? Why   are   these   issues   important?   (Note   that   because this is a statistics class rather than a   policy course, this will   be   just one short   paragraph.)
2.       Methods: What   is your   data   source   for   addressing   these   issues? Very briefly,   how   did   you analyze the data? (Again, a very short paragraph,   for this   class.)
3.       Findings:   What   did   you   find?   (Normally,   this   section   will be   the   bulk   of your   memo.   For   this   class,   it   will   comprise   one   table   and   perhaps   one   figure,   and   one   interpretive   paragraph). Here are a   few tips:
Do
•         Include one good table   and perhaps one   good   figure.
•         Use this section to tell the story that was revealed   in your   analysis.
•         Highlight the most important and interesting findings.
•         Tell    important    things       first      and       save      details      for      last      (or    omit    them   altogether).
•         Use   bolding   and   bullets   to   separate   elements   of   the   story,   as   needed.
•         Draw    your    reader’s    attention      to      important      trends      in      the      tables.      For   example,   “As   shown   in   Table   1,   Group    1   and   Group   2   differed   on   the   following characteristics   …”.
Do not
•         Bury important findings in   minutiae
•         Use   space   in   your   “Findings”   section   to   recount   every   statistic   in   your   table(s). In other words, be selective!
4.       Conclusions:    How    do    your      findings      address      the      question      that      you      posed      in      the   introduction? What do you conclude? Briefly,   what are the limitations of   your analysis?   (For us, this is one paragraph.)
